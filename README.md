## Who am I?

My name is Arthur Powers. I hold a BS in Game Design and Development after studying at RIT for 3 years. 
I enjoy every step of the design process, from developing a sturdy back-end to showcasing colorful and lively
front-end pages.

## What I'm Working On
I am a developer for Crowd Comic, a platform where readers, writers, and artists from anywhere can collaborate to build interactive comics. Crowd Comic is looking to capture the beautiful disharmony that comes from individual perspectives and aims to create a story greater than the sum of its parts.

## Languages
- JavaScript/Typescript (front and back end)
- HTML/CSS
- .NET C#
- C++

## Favorite Libraries/APIs
p5.js and OpenAI API
